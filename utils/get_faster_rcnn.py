    Constructs an improved Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone from `Benchmarking Detection
    Transfer Learning with Vision Transformers <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11429>`__ paper.

    .. betastatus:: detection module

    It works similarly to Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 FPN backbone. See
    :func:`~torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` for more
    details.

    Args:
        weights (:class:`~torchvision.models.detection.FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights to use. See
            :class:`~torchvision.models.detection.FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights` below for
            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        num_classes (int, optional): number of output classes of the model (including the background)
        weights_backbone (:class:`~torchvision.models.ResNet50_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights for the backbone.
        trainable_backbone_layers (int, optional): number of trainable (not frozen) layers starting from
            final block. Valid values are between 0 and 5, with 5 meaning all backbone layers are
            trainable. If ``None`` is passed (the default) this value is set to 3.
        **kwargs: parameters passed to the ``torchvision.models.detection.faster_rcnn.FasterRCNN``
            base class. Please refer to the `source code
            <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/faster_rcnn.py>`_
            for more details about this class.
